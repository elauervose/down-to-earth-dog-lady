    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Meet Erin the <span class="text-muted">Down to Earth Dog Lady</span></h2>
    <p class="lead">
      I have worked in the dog business for over 10 years and am a <a href="http://www.ccpdt.org/about-us/">certified professional dog trainer</a> and <a href="https://www.karenpryoracademy.com/why-choose-a-KPA-CTP">Karen Pryor clicker training partner</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      My passion is for helping dogs and humans become part of the pack and feel loved and comfortable together. With my training background I can help with leash pulling, aggression, anxiety, or any home or public issues you'd like to be worked on as well.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      For me, dogs are all about having fun and being happy together. They can seem to run on pure enthusiasm and play.  Most importantly, I believe dogs bring out our better selves. When people play with and connect with their dogs, they are connecting to fun, play, and joy.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      One of the best ways to connect with your dog is by learning a new skill together. My classes and private lessons are all about establishing trust and confidence between you, your dog, and myself.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I like to say, "A <em>good</em> trainer will teach you things you can do with your dog, but a <em>great</em> trainer will help you connect with your playful, happy, furry buddy."
    </p>
    <!-- <p class="lead">
      I am certified in pet first aid as well. I have worked in large vet hospitals and have dealt with administering lots of different medication. I have also worked in several feed and local holistic dog food companies where I gained a wide range of knowledge about dog nutrition.

    <p class="lead">
      I believe dogs and their humans should work as a seamless team. That means my focus in training is always to help you and your dog find what works best for you both.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I like to start by clarifying what your goals are for you and your dog. Then we can work together to design the best possible strategy for achieving those goals.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I have a solid grounding in several training styles and methodologies but I always use positive reinforcement in my classes and with clients.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      It's important to me that both the human and the canine half of every team feel successful and have fun working together.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      That means I will always strive to make sure you feel encouraged, supported, and successful because I know that when you feel confident and relaxed, your dog will pick up on that and the training is so much more productive.

      I have two fantastic - and very different - dogs. Although they both love meeting new friends and helping me with demonstration in classes, they have each challenged me in different ways and taught me things very different things about dogs.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      My two-year-old Australian shepherd has a sweet, sensitive personality with a knack for bringing anyone into the pack in short order, while my 8-year-old terrier has that classic, independent terrier spirit with a goofy, playful side and a penchant for snuggling everyone he meets.
