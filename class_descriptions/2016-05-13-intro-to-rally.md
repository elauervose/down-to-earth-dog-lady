<p>
  Rally Obedience (or Rally-O) is a fun obstacle-course type activity you and your dog navigate together as a team.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you are looking for a competitive new challenge or just a way to burn off extra energy when it's rainy and muddy out in winter months, Rally is an excellent way to go.
</p>
<h5 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: 500;">Here are just a few reasons why Rally-O is awesome:</h5>
<ul data-bullet="ti-star">
  <li>Build a stronger bond with your dog</li>
  <li>Mentally challenge your high energy dog</li>
  <li>Build and reinforce discipline and impulse control in fun, engaging ways</li>
  <li>A great in-door activity for rainy days</li>
  <li>All kinds of dogs at any age are welcome! <em>(provided they are physically sound and capable of completing the courses)</em></li>
  <li>Have fun and feel successful relatively quickly - Rally-O is one of the easiest ‘dog sports’ to get into for newbies</li>
  <li>You can (but don't have to) compete and win awards with your dog in a friendly, welcoming, encouraging, positive environment</li>
</ul>
