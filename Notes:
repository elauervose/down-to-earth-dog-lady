Notes:

Photos to Get
--------------
* Photo of pet sitting dogs at your house where they are in the foreground (most look like they are in the back - behind your dogs)

* Pack Hike landscape photo where the scenic horizon is almost parallel to dogs heads (so I can crop them the a few inches tall and as wide as the page)

* Better photo of Skully closeup, looking at the camera

* Photo(s) of Kim and Skully on a Pack hike (for Kim's profile/team pic)

* Photo of each stage of the pack hike (loading the car, walking on leash, drinking water, playing frizbee, new or small dog in float-coat/lifejacket - already have lots near water - )
