              I have over ten years of experience working in the dog industry. I am a certified professional dog trainer, a Karen Pryor clicker training partner, and am certified in pet first aid.
            </p>
            <p>
              I actively train with my Australian shepherd in Rally-O competitions, and regularly train my pack out on Oregon’s amazing hiking trails year-round.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my own pack, I have trained more dogs that I could count and have experience with puppies of all ages, adult rescue dogs, and purebred dogs.  <a href="/about">Read more about me &amp; my training style here</a>

                      Otis is a spunky 8 year old terrier who has been with Erin since the beginning. His goofy characteristics and gentle charm makes him the perfect assistant  in most lessons with puppies, and out on the town lessons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Otis understands what it’s like to work through tough problems - he has had his share! My clients take confidence from Otis that they can help their dog overcome issues too!  He’ll greet you and your dog with a kiss on the  face and make you laugh through any training session.

                    <p>
                      Dahlia is one of our pack leaders on the Pack Hikes. She has been with me since she was  eight weeks old and we have been training since day one. Now, at two years old, she will help build your dog’s confidence out on the town, in home, and out on the trail. Dahlia brings a wonderful motherly and calming energy to any training session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She helps me during leash aggression training sessions, and makes sure your dog comes back when called on hikes.  If your dog loves a good frisbee or fetch game Dahlia’s right there to provide extra fun!

              Angyl brings extensive shelter, training, and daycare experience to the Dog Lady team. Angyl also volunteers at the Oregon Humane Society. Angyl and Erin first met at a dog training facility/school in Milwaukee, Oregon four years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since she was a little girl Angyl has always loved dogs. She was raised with Rottweilers of all shapes and sizes and knows what it takes to be a true Doglady. Her passion for working with dogs and rehabilitating them brings a unique and fun addition to the team.

                      Eve brings a fun and playful aspect to the pack that we have not had a chance to see before. You will also see Eve in many of Angyl's training sessions to help calm reactive dogs.

            <p>
              I love and take care of all animals that are under my care from friends family and even neighbors! My love for animals started at a young age and I knew ever since I was little that I wanted to work with animals. I’m so grateful that this job and so many of my other jobs have given me the opportunity to do what I love!
