Rally Obedience (or Rally-O) is a fun obstacle-course type activity you and your dog navigate together as a team.

Whether you are looking for a competitive new challenge or just a way to burn off extra energy when it's rainy and muddy out in winter months, Rally is an excellent way to go.

#####Here are just a few reasons why Rally-O is awesome:

* Build a stronger bond with your dog
* Mentally challenge your high energy dog
* Build and reinforce discipline and impulse control in fun, engaging ways
* A great in-door activity for rainy days
* All kinds of dogs at any age are welcome!
* Have fun and feel successful relatively quickly - Rally-O is one of the easiest ‘dog sports’ to get into for newbies
* You can (but don't have to) compete and win awards with your dog in a friendly, welcoming, encouraging, positive environment
