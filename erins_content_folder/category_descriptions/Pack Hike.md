A pack hike is an alternative way to exercise and socialize your dog. Pack Hikes give your dog a chance to have a change in scenery once or twice a week, have a group of friends that only consists of five to seven dogs, and the ability to play and run in a way few daycare facilities can provide.

Training throughout the whole hike is an important part of the Pack Hike, it provides mental stimulation and teaches critical skills like; recall, proper ways to meet new dogs, manners for meeting strangers, and appropriate play amongst the pack members.

With the freedom to run and play with a trusted pack in the beautiful landscape of the Pacific Northwest, these hikes will leave your dog happy, tired, and well trained!
