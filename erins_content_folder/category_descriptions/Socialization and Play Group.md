This socialization and play group is like homeschool for dogs! It's an alternative social outlet for dogs who tend to be more comfortable in smaller packs to build their confidence and social skills, and nap and play throughout the day while you're at work.

We follow a daily routine consisting of pack walks, toy time, lunch time snack, nap break, and much more.

The dogs are under constant professional supervision dogs are never left unattended.
